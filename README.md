A creative frontend experiment built entirely with **HTML** and **CSS**, simulating a fully interactive 3D environment — no JavaScript involved.

## ✨ What Is CSS 3D Room?

**CSS 3D Room** is a fully responsive, interactive 3D space created using only HTML & CSS.  
From walls and floors to dynamic hover animations, the entire room comes to life with simple code and smart use of `transform` and `perspective`.

> No JavaScript. No frameworks. Just pure frontend creativity.  

⚡ A perfect showcase of modern CSS capabilities, UI/UX micro-interactions, and 3D design thinking — all done with clean, semantic code.
